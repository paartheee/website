summary: When you go out to buy a shirt for yourself, you will not buy something which is very fit for your body because then if you eat pizza or biryani and if you become fat it will not be convenient you will not buy something that is very loose because then it looks like a cloth hanging on a skeleton, you will try to buy a right fit for your body the problem of overfitting and underfitting happening in the machine learning project as well, and there are techniques to tackle this overfitting and under fitting issue and these techniques are called regularization techniques.
